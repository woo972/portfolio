# Engineering-Portfolio
This repository contains real-world system design case studies based on production experience.
Each document focuses on **technical decision-making**, **trade-offs**, and **failure-aware architecture design** rather than implementation details.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how I approach complex backend and distributed system problems as a Staff-level Individual Contributor.
